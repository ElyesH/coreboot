 *
 * Every domain has a fixed set of ranges. These ranges cannot be

 * represent the available windows from which resources can be allocated
 * to the different devices under the domain.
 *
 * In order to identify the requirements of downstream devices, resource
 * allocator walks in a DFS fashion. It gathers the requirements from
 * leaf devices and propagates those back up to their upstream bridges
 * until the requirements for all the downstream devices of the domain
 * are gathered. This is referred to as pass 1 of the resource allocator.
 *
 * Once the requirements for all the devices under the domain are
 * gathered, the resource allocator walks a second time to allocate
 * resources to downstream devices as per the requirements. It always
 * picks the biggest resource request as per the type (i/o and mem) to
 * allocate space from its fixed window to the immediate downstream
 * device of the domain. In order to accomplish best fit for the
 * resources, a list of ranges is maintained by each resource type (i/o
 * and mem). At the domain level we don't differentiate between mem and
 * prefmem. Since they are allocated space from the same window, the
 * resource allocator at the domain level ensures that the biggest
 * requirement is selected independent of the prefetch type. Once the
 * resource allocation for all immediate downstream devices is complete
 * at the domain level, the resource allocator walks down the subtree
 * for each downstream bridge to continue the allocation process at the
 * bridge level. Since bridges have either their whole window allocated
 * or nothing, we only need to place downstream resources inside these
 * windows by re-using offsets that were pre-calculated in pass 1. This
 * continues until resource allocation is realized for all downstream
 * bridges in the domain sub-tree. This is referred to as pass 2 of the
 * resource allocator.
 *
 * Some rules that are followed by the resource allocator:
 *  - Allocate resource locations for every device as long as
 *    the requirements can be satisfied.
 *  - Don't overlap with resources in fixed locations.
 *  - Don't overlap and follow the rules of bridges -- downstream
 *    devices of bridges should use parts of the address space
